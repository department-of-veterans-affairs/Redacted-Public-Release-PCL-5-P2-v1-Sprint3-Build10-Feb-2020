For VHA health care team members (e.g., referring provider, MH intake provider, MH treatment providers, etc.)
Who need to assess and care for Veterans at high risk from the point of identification of need for Mental Health services through their care in mental health
A process of capturing information (e.g., assessment and stratification data) is needed to support managing information related to identifying the urgency of and progress in care of all MH referrals. 
That will ensure Veterans at risk for suicide receive timely and appropriate care in the proper setting based on the results of the initial and ongoing assessment and allow for tracking of disposition for timeliness and access to care 
Unlike current processes where there is no standardization of gathering and capturing information resulting in inconsistent sharing of information for Veterans at risk for suicide
Our Process will enable the standardization of documentation for MH referrals, facilitating completion of the initial brief triage and suicide risk assessments for all Veterans being referred for MH services; thereby supporting open access to care and providing consistency in best practices and quality.
